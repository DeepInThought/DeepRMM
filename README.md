# DeepRMM
This project board will serve as the home for the upcoming DeepRMM repository.  Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) is a tool used by Managed Service Providers (MSP) to streamline support services to businesses and end-users.  The goal of DeepRMM is to provide a clear open source alternative and avoid vendor lock-ins by providing a transparent code base.  With offerings from the DevOps world to provide continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines such as [CircleCI], [TravisCI], [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com), [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org), etc.
